## About Me
War Eagle! I am a recent graduate from Auburn University (Spring 2025), where I completed my B.S. in Computer Science with a Certification in Artificial Intelligence Engineering. I grew up and currently reside in the Philadelphia area, and am a HUGE Philadelphia sports fan. Some other hobbies include fitness, music, cooking, language learning, and cultural discovery (Hispanic culture in particular). I love to learn and discover new things, whether that is a new subgenre of music, a recipe or cooking hack, or breakthroughs and applications in the AI field.

I am currently working as a Software Engineering Intern at CosoLogic, specializing in Generative AI and data integration, and frontend work. Through my academic and professional experience, I've developed a strong foundation in AI/ML, software engineering, and data science. 

I'm passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technology to solve complex problems, with particular interests in:
- Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling
- Generative AI
- Natural Language Processing and Conversational AI
- Data Engineering and Analytics
- Technical Solution Architecture
