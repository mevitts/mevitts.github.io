## About Me
War Eagle! I am a recent graduate from Auburn University (Spring 2025), where I completed my B.S. in Computer Science with a Certification in Artificial Intelligence Engineering. I grew up and currently reside in the Philadelphia area, and am a HUGE Philadelphia sports fan. Some other hobbies include fitness, music, cooking, language learning, and cultural discovery (Hispanic culture in particular). I love to learn and discover new things, whether that is a new subgenre of music, a recipe or cooking hack, or breakthroughs and applications in the AI field.

I am currently working as a Software Engineering Intern at CosoLogic, specializing in Generative AI and data integration, and frontend work. Through my academic and professional experience, I've developed a strong foundation in AI/ML, software engineering, and data science. I have gained hands on experience across the entire stack, from designeing robust data pipelines to creating engaging user interfaces, and am always looking to grow my experiences and take on new challenges.

I'm passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technology to solve complex problems, with particular interests in:
- Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling
- Generative AI
- Natural Language Processing and Conversational AI
- Data Engineering and Analytics
- Technical Solution Architecture

## Featured Projects

### [Spanish Conversational Voice Bot](https://github.com/mevitts/spanish_chat_bot)
<div class="highlight">
An innovative language learning tool combining speech recognition, LLMs, and realistic text-to-speech capabilities to provide users with an immersive Spanish conversational experience. This project finetunes the (`whisper-small) model on Spanish audio for precise transcription, and deploys a comprehensive voice to voice interaction pipeline. Still in development, future plans are to use Spanish podcast audio and transcription data to further train the whisper model on more convsersation based audio. Being able to support a diverse range of Spanish accents which would include local slang and phrases is another feature to be added in the near future to improve the user's immersive experience.

### [Repo Analyzer AI](https://github.com/mevitts/Repo-Analyzer-AI)
<div class="highlight">
A multi-agent AI pipeline built with Google's ADK that performs a comprehensive, architectural analysis of a software repository. I plan on adding a web interface, a repo comparison feature in the near future, and also plan on using RAG to incorporate a chat bot that can answer the user's questions about the repository.

### [March Madness Tournament Predictor](https://github.com/mevitts/March_Madness)
<div class="highlight">
In this machine learning project, I built a model that could predict tournament outcomes with about 76% accuracy. Involving XGBoost and Gradient Boosting Classifiers implementations, along with using KenPom efficiency metrics & historical tournament data for training. These decisions and features were guided by thorough data visualization and statistical evaluation, helping highlight the most optimal features and most effective model. In this process, I created a reproducible data pipeline for efficient data extraction and model evaluation. The model was deployed to create predictions for this year's March Madness Tournament, and it achieved a total game accuracy of 61.9%, resulting inside the average accuracy score of a bracket (60-65%).

**Other projects include:**
- [VLM PDF Parser for RAG (Docling & Ollama Integration)](https://github.com/mevitts/Docling.VLM.RAGProcessor): Combines Docling and Ollama to prepare data for use in RAG systems by intelligently processing documents of different formats (pdf, pptx, docx, etc.). It focuses on extracting and structuring content from various complex layouts, and uses VLM capabilities to create detailed descriptions of extracted images to further increase document understanding.
- [Forest Fire Multi-Agent Simulation](https://github.com/mevitts/ForestFire_MAS): Created for Auburn's Multi-Agent Systems course. Uses the AgentPy library to create a multi-agent system to simulate different dynamics of forest fires. Models how different elements (trees, fire spread, environmental conditions) and agents (control base, firefighters, drones) interact to create insights about complex systems.
- [AI Assignment Collection](https://github.com/mevitts/AI): Assignments from Auburn's Artificial Intelligence course. It is a collection of various smaller AI projects with a range of different machine learning applications. This includes comparing RNN and LSTM architectures on movie genre prediction based on movie descriptions, CNN architecture for image classification, Gaussian Naive-Bayes vs Logisic Regression for customer churn analysis, and a Multinomial Naive Bayes movie review sentiment analysis classifier.

  
## Professional Experience

### CosoLogic (Remote)
**Frontend Developer â€“ Generative AI, UI and Data Integration** *(May 2025 - Present)*
At my current position, I am getting hands-on experience on a wide variety of ___. I have deployed and integrated an automated data pipeline that churns out real-time analytics into a full-stack data exploration platform, using React and TypeScript on the frontend. Also, I have conducted research on different AI-driven solutions for document parsing to prepare data for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This eventually led to my current work in developing a system that leverages Docling and OpenAI's API to extract document text, images, and add in image descriptions to be used in RAG systems.

### Hexagon Asset Lifecycle Intelligence (Huntsville, AL)
**Software Automation Engineer**
During this position, I developed 22 internal automation tools using .NET, which significantly optimized operational efficiency. These solutions successfully reduced setup times from hours or even days to mere minutes. My contributions included building custom command scripts and developing user-friendly WinForms GUIs, with direct presentation of technical results to key stakeholders.

### TESICNOR (Pamplona, Spain)
**International Engineering Intern**
As an International Engineering Intern, my responsibilities encompassed a broad range of engineering tasks, including designing and creating controller adapters for VR training simulations in forest fire combat. This design process involved 3D modeling with Blender. Also, I regularly collaborated with company representatives, presenting project progress and technical results during weekly reviews. Furthermore, working daily in a bilingual environment provided consistent opportunities to actively apply and refine my Spanish language skills.
